# Udacity-Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, I will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. I will then document my wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.

In case you are unable to gather data from the url or the twitter API, I have provided the gathered datasets.
